I have some great news!  
I've finally finished developing my own website!!! My portfolio!  
Here, I will be able to publish some content related to **cybersecurity** and everything I've developed and will develop throughout the years in the field.

I already planned to write some new [series](https://fssecur3.github.io/series/ "Series"):

+ **Tools** - Collection of personal developed tools
+ **Proof of Concepts** - Proof of Concepts of some (and latest) CVE's and known vulnerabilities
+ **TOPs** - Best of some tools and other things
+ **Reviews** - Reviews of cybersecurity related content
+ **Tutorials** - Tutorials and how-to of tools, utilities, etc.

Besides that, I'll report my new and old projects here!

The website is being hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/fssecur3/fssecur3.github.io "Source code").  
Don't forget to check it out [here](https://fssecur3.github.io/ "Francisco Spínola's Portfolio").
