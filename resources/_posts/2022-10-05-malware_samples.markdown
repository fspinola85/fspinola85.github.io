## SUMMARY

Malware is part of almost everyone that uses technology, at some point of their life. Us, researchers, must be able to access malware to understand it and, more importantly, to know how to protect ourselves and others from these threats.  
As a cybersecurity enthusiast and researcher, as I gained experience, I found and saved some useful websites and repositories that would provide some malware samples, so I decided to share these resources as a list (sorted by malware type) for those who want quick access to malware samples.  
Every source listed below contains more than 1 malware.  
> Disclaimer: Don't use any of the samples listed on these sources to attack or even 'troll' someone (or some entity). Use them at your own risk. Be careful!
